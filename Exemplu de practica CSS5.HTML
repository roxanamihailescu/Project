						One of the biggest challenges we face when it comes to relaxation is to find time for this activity.
						We feel that we never have enough time to do whatever we propose.
						That's why it's very hard for us to find time for relaxation.
						What we are not aware of is that when we find enough time to relax, we can charge our batteries so that we can achieve what we have intended.
						Solution: Make relaxation a priority!
						Listen to relaxing music or just go for a relaxing massage.
						Choose an activity to disconnect everything that's around you and see how soon the benefits of this decision will come.

						It is important to discover what really helps you to relax.
						The simple fact of sitting and doing nothing may not work for everyone.
						Perhaps for others, true relaxation consists of a walk in nature, meditation or sitting in the arms of a loved one.

						When you decide to relax, you become aware of all the tension accumulated in your body, a tension that you have not even noticed before.
						The result is that you will not feel relaxed or even want to return to your activities to make you feel better.
						In this sense, the key is to continue to stay in that state because these sensations will gradually diminish.
						After a few minutes, you will feel more relaxed and relaxed.
